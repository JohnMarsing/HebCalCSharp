# HebCalCSharp
A c# .net core console app designed to pull content from the HebCall Rest API on an annual basis

## My Hebrew Bible Association
For my website [My Hebrew Bible](https://myhebrewbible.com/) I have to update the list of weekly *parashot* (Torah portion reading list) on an annual basis [see the list](https://myhebrewbible.com/Parasha/Annual).  What date the portion is read gets changed every year (by whom exactly I don't know) and I need to pull from the HebCal API using REST

## Motivation | New Technologies
Beyond getting this task done I wanted to learn some new technologies 
- In general, working with REST
- Working with GitHub
- Working with VS Code

## Project Structure - inspired by K. Scott Allen
### Structuring a Repository [see](https://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/archive/2018/08/28/net-core-opinion-1-structuring-a-repository.aspx)
1. A src folder, where all projects will live in sub-folders.
2. A test folder, where all unit test projects will live in sub-folders
3. A .sln file in the root of the repository (for Visual Studio environment only)
